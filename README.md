# Roshan_Alte_Cardiovascular_Risk_Prediction-Classification-
This is the Capstone project which is a part of my Data Science training at AlmaBetter.

# Introduction -
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

The dataset provides the patients information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

Now a days people are going more towards sedentary lifestyle. Due to inactive lifestyle and consumption of tobacco the risk of CHD is increasing day by day.

In this project we will be developing various machine learning models which will predict the 10yr future risk of CHD.

# Problem Statement - 
1. The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
2. In this project our classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) from dataset of an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.

# Conclusion - 
1. From EDA - 
* Men are more likely to develop CHD than women.
* Smoking is a risk factor for CHD, and smoking intensity plays a role in determining the risk.
* Patients who have had a prevalent stroke and prevalent hypertension are more likely to be at risk for CHD.
* Total cholesterol levels are slightly higher in patients at risk for CHD
* There is a positive relationship between certain variables such as age and systolic blood pressure, BMI and glucose levels.


2. From Model Implementation -
* Among the Three models tested, the Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost models performed the best, with high accuracy, precision, and recall scores.

* The Logistic Regression model had a lower accuracy and precision, Recall score, indicating that it may not be as suitable for this particular classification problem.

* **The Random Forest Classifier model had slightly higher test accuracy** and Recall scores than the XGBoost, suggesting that it may be a better choice for predicting cardiovascular risk.

* Based on the results presented, **the Random Forest Classifier** model was chosen as the best fit classification model for the cardiovascular risk prediction dataset **having accuracy of 89.58%.**
